I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University (Fall 2025). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis in May 2025, advised by Dr. [Raj Jain](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/). My research interests include quantum computing, security, networking, and machine learning. My current work focuses on advancing scalable quantum computing through distributed quantum computing and quantum networks. Additionally, I have worked on network performance and decentralization, with an emphasis on resource management, routing, blockchains, and machine learning.

Prior to this, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at companies such as Tencent, Baidu, and DJI between 2011 and 2017. I received my bachelor degree in computer engineering from Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Guangzhou, China in 2012 and my master degree in computer engineering from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan in 2019.

<em>We are hiring self-motivated Ph.D., Master’s, and undergraduate students. If you’re interested, feel free to send me your resume.</em>
